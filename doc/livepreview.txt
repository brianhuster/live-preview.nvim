1. Introduction                                     
								*livepreview*

live-preview.nvim is a plugin for Neovim that allows you to view Markdown, HTML
(along with CSS, JavaScript) and AsciiDoc files in a web browser with live
updates. No external dependencies or runtime like NodeJS or Python are
required, since the backend is fully written in Lua and Neovim’s built-in
functions.

2. Configuration                                                   
							    *livepreview-config*

You can customize the plugin by passing a table to the `opts` variable (if you
use lazy.nvim) or the function `require('livepreview').setup()`. Here is the
default configuration (in Lua): >lua
    {
        cmd = "LivePreview", 
        port = 5500, 
        autokill = false, 
        browser = 'default', 
        dynamic_root = false, 
        sync_scroll = false, 
        picker = nil, 
    }

Explaination of each option:
- `cmd`: Main command of live-preview.nvim
- `port`: Port to run the live preview server on.
- autokill: If true, the plugin will autokill other processes running on the
  same port (except for Neovim) when starting the server.
- `browser`: Terminal command to open the browser for live-previewing (eg.
  'firefox', 'flatpak run com.vivaldi.Vivaldi'). By default, it will use the
  system's default browser.
- sync_scroll: If true, the plugin will sync the scrolling in the browser as
  you scroll in the Markdown files in Neovim.
- `picker`: Picker to use for opening files. 3 choices are available: |telescope|,
  |fzf-lua|, |mini.pick|. If nil, the plugin look for the first available picker
  when you call the `pick` command.

Note: If you wish to config the plugin in Vimscript, see |v:lua-call| for
instruction on how to call Lua function in Vimscript

Use `:checkhealth livepreview` to see your configuration inside Neovim

3. Usage                                                   
							    *livepreview-usage*

							    *:LivePreview*
This instruction assumes that you are using default configuration
(`opts.cmd = "LivePreview"`). If you have changed the command name, replace
with the command name in your config

- To start the live preview, use the command: >vim
    :LivePreview start
<
This command will open the current Markdown or HTML file in your default web
browser and update it live as you write changes to your file.

You can also parse a file path as argument, for example `:LivePreview start
test/doc.md`

- To stop the live preview server, use the command: >vim
    :LivePreview close
<
- To open a picker and select a file to preview, use the command: >vim
    :LivePreview pick
<
- To see document about each subcommand, use the command: >vim
    :LivePreview help
<
This requires a picker to be installed (Telescope, fzf-lua or mini.pick). If
you have multiple pickers installed, you can specify the picker to use by
passing the picker name to the configuration table (see |livepreview-config|)

5. FAQ												   
							    *livepreview-faq*

WHY DOESN'T THE RELATIVE LINK (`../`) WORK? ~

Make sure the webroot of the server is the same as the root directory of 
your project. To find the webroot of the server, run >vim
    :checkhealth livepreview
< 
The result is shown in the section `Server and process` of the checkhealth 
buffer.

Also, don't set `dynamic_root` to `true` when unnecessary. You can also see
live-preview.nvim config using `:checkhealth livepreview`
